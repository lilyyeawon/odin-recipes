                <li>Granulated sugar</li>
                <li>Baking powder</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>

                <li>Almond Milk</li>
                <li>Whipped cream or coconut cream</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together the dry ingredients in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the coconut oil and use your hands to work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
                <li>Add the lemon zest, juice, almond milk, and eggs and mix until just combined.</li>
                <li>Turn it out onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper, pat it into a rectangle, and fold it into thirds. Pat or roll the folded dough to about 1 inch thick, and freeze it for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>After the dough chills, cut out the biscuits.</li>
                <li>Pop them in a 400-degree oven for about 17 minutes, or until theyâ€™re lightly golden brown around the edges.</li>
                <li>Pull the biscuits out of the oven and allow them to cool slightly before you assemble the shortcakes.</li>
                <li>Layer them with the strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
            </ol>
